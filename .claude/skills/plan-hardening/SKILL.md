# Plan Hardening

Audience: `team-lead` only.

Use this only for phase-plan hardening before implementation starts or resumes.

## Assumptions

- the current plan state already exists in repo docs, though sprint docs may
  still be partial or missing
- do not ask the user to explain detailed plan content; read the planning docs
  and references directly after they are created
- `team-lead` routes the process but is not the authority for rewriting the
  plan
- the user-discussed deliverable scope is authoritative
- if no target phase worktree exists, create one from `develop` before
  starting
- `team-lead` is a coordinator only and must not redirect hardening flow,
  offer accept-and-proceed shortcuts, or stop to ask the user what to do when
  an in-scope hardening loop is still mechanically actionable

## Expected Result

Sprint plan approved by:
- `plan-scope-reviewer`
- `critical-plan-reviewer`
- `quality-mgr` (plan QA-1 includes `ceremony-qa`)

The approved plan is a set of parallel tracks with non-intersecting
`owned_paths`, aiming at the shortest critical path with the fewest sprints.
A cross-boundary feature is cut into a contract sprint, parallel layer
sprints that each close one boundary against contract tests, and its own
integration sprint that owns its end-to-end criteria. Independent changes
and single-boundary features stay as their own sprints or stacked tracks;
thin layer sprints are as much a defect as full-stack feature sprints. The
phase plan carries a wave table with critical path, width and sprint count,
and every name follows "Naming" in the guidelines. Hardening exists to make that shape safe to run in
parallel; it must never make a plan more serial. Record `critical_path` and
`width` from the `plan-scope-reviewer` output in the round table's Note
column, and treat a round that lengthens the critical path as a regression to
be explained.

Hardening improves the plan's deliverables; it does not grow process.
Findings whose only remedy is a new manifest, inventory, receipt, or CI gate
must pass the "Process Artifacts" rule in `sprint-planning-guidelines.md`.
Before routing step 2 or step 4 findings to the developer, `team-lead` runs
`ceremony-finding-screen` over them and drops any `ceremony` or
`concern_valid_remedy_ceremony` verdict it upholds as `rejected: ceremony`,
recording the reason in the round table Note.

## Required Reference

Always use:
- `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/sprint-planning-guidelines.md`
- `.claude/project/quality-policy.md` for repository-specific plan naming,
  boundary manifests, and validation commands

## Execution Table

| # | Route to | Input required | Output expected | Read before executing |
|---|----------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | developer | vars file | `step-1` fenced JSON | `steps/step-1.md` |
| 2 | `plan-scope-reviewer` (background) | context + `step-1` JSON | `step-2` fenced JSON | `steps/step-2.md` |
| 3 | developer | `step-2` JSON | `step-3` fenced JSON | `steps/step-3.md` |
| 4 | `critical-plan-reviewer` (background) | context + `step-3` JSON | `step-4` fenced JSON | `steps/step-4.md` |
| 5 | developer | `step-4` JSON | `step-5` fenced JSON | `steps/step-5.md` |
| 6 | `quality-mgr` | `step-5` JSON + QA vars file | codex-orchestration plan-QA handoff | `steps/step-6.md` |

## Round Tracking

`team-lead` must keep a round table for every `/plan-hardening` run.

Minimum columns:

| Round | Step | Reviewer | reviewed_commit | status | blocking | important | minor | findings_hash | supersedes | Note |
|-------|------|----------|-----------------|--------|----------|-----------|-------|---------------|------------|------|

Use the example in:
- `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/examples/plan-hardening-rounds.example.md`

## Reviewer Cycle Caps

- `plan-scope-reviewer`, `critical-plan-reviewer`, and step-6 plan QA
  (`quality-mgr`) all default to a 3-cycle cap
- these caps must be carried in JSON:
  - `plan_scope_review_cycle_limit`
  - `critical_review_cycle_limit`
  - `plan_qa_cycle_limit`
- reviewer launch payloads must also include:
  - `review_cycle_limit`
  - `review_cycle_index`
- if the vars JSON omits the cap fields, `team-lead` must default them to `3`

Cycle-cap behavior:

- every `FAIL` from `plan-scope-reviewer` or `critical-plan-reviewer` must be
  routed to the developer immediately through the matching plan-editing step
- no reviewer findings may be accepted as-is or bypass the plan-editing agent
- if a reviewer returns `FAIL` on the final allowed reviewer cycle, `team-lead`
  must still send those findings to the developer for one final correction pass
- after that final correction pass, if no reviewer cycles remain, stop the
  hardening run as `cap-exhausted / not converged` and report status plainly
- do not ask the user how to proceed, do not offer multiple-choice options,
  and do not invent an "accept and proceed" path

## Hard Stops

- `team-lead` only checks the top-level `status` and expected `mode` fields on
  each fenced JSON response before advancing
- every step after step 1 must receive the previous step's fenced JSON
- missing or malformed fenced JSON is a hard stop
- a reviewer rerun is valid only when either `reviewed_commit` changed or
  `findings_hash` changed
- if the same reviewer returns the same `reviewed_commit` and the same
  `findings_hash` again, treat it as a stale replay and do not open a new
  hardening round
- substantial scope drift from the user-discussed plan is a hard stop
- remaining in-scope work without sprint ownership is a hard stop
- if a sprint cannot credibly land its committed deliverables at a
  production-ready level for its closure type, split it along boundaries into
  sibling sprints before implementation; a serial split of a feature sprint
  is not an accepted correction
- if a reviewer loop reaches its configured cap without converging, stop after
  routing the last findings to the developer and report `cap-exhausted / not
  converged`; do not continue launching background reviewers and do not ask
  the user for a decision mid-loop

## Workflow Metadata

Every template in this skill declares ATM template metadata
(`metadata.type`, `metadata.tags`, `metadata.workflow`; see
`docs/template-workflow-metadata.md`). The declared stage is `plan`, so any
message rendered from one of them is discoverable without reading its body:

```sh
atm search --team <team> --workflow-stage plan --since <ISO> --json
atm search --team <team> --type 'plan-*' --since <ISO> --json
```

Rounds that run a reviewer as a background agent (steps 2 and 4) produce no
ATM message on their own; the step docs require a `plan-review-notice` send
after each such round so the run stays observable. Rounds routed to a team
agent instead of a background agent use `plan-critical-review.xml.j2` (vars:
`examples/plan-critical-review-vars.example.json`) (or
the numbered assignment templates) and are recorded by that dispatch.
Install the templates before the first send:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.atm/templates/plan-hardening && cp .claude/skills/plan-hardening/*.j2 ~/.atm/templates/plan-hardening/
```
